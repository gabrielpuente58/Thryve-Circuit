## Features

- **Multi-screen navigation** with Expo Router:

  - **Home Screen** (dashboard overview)
  - **Workouts Screen** (list of available workouts)

  - Steps count down with `useState` and `useEffect`.
  - Auto-advances to the next step until finished.

- **User input**

  - **TextInput**: Adjust the duration for all Rest steps.
  - **Switch**: Toggle haptics on/off.

- **Feedback**

  - **Haptics** on each step change and completion.
  - **Alert** when leaving a workout.
  - **Progress bars** that show time remaining.
  - Celebration ðŸŽ‰ when finished.

- **Extra Expo packages**
  - [`expo-haptics`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/haptics/) â†’ Vibrations for feedback.
  - [`expo-keep-awake`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/keep-awake/) â†’ Prevents screen from sleeping during a workout.
